/**
If joined impulse components in m_jim are not too high
sync other bodies (mB:s in ejStack) to match mA using rigid body statistics
and add required impulses.
If limits are exceeded during process restart is needed.
To avoid restarts mA should be picked well.
Currently it is done manually.

For simple moment limited cases (cantilever beam) nearest mB can be used as master body
if moment is exceeded.

For other scenarios work is needed.
